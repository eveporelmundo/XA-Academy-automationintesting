# Testing Project - Automation in Testing

## Project Status

**Status:** Completed

---

## Project Description

This project focuses on the analysis, design, execution, documentation, and automation of tests for the following web application:

https://automationintesting.online/

The application simulates a Bed & Breakfast booking platform called **Shady Meadows B&B**, where users can view available rooms, make reservations, submit contact messages, and access an administration panel.

The objective of this project was to apply manual testing, exploratory testing, functional testing, form validation testing, bug reporting, and Cypress automation in a realistic QA workflow.

The project also includes workflow automation using **n8n**, **Trello**, and **Google Sheets / Excel** to improve bug reporting and traceability.

## Cypress Files Description

### `cypress/e2e/myTestRestfulBooker.cy.js`

Main Cypress spec file.

It contains the automated test suite for:

* Home page validation.
* Available rooms validation.
* Booking flow.
* Booking form validations.
* Contact form submission.

Custom commands were used to reduce duplicated code and make the tests easier to read.

Examples of reusable actions:

* Selecting booking dates.
* Filling the booking form.
* Filling the contact form.
* Logging into the admin panel.
* Validating loaded images.

---

### `cypress/support/e2e.js`

![Automated Bug Reporting Workflow](docs/images/automation.png)
## Manual Test Documentation

The project includes a structured test case and bug report spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet contains:

* Test Case ID.
* Module.
* Description.
* Preconditions.
* Steps.
* Expected Result.
* Actual Result.
* Executed.
* Status.
* Criticality.
* Automated.
* Trello Ticket.

The spreadsheet was designed to support both manual testing and automation traceability.

---

## Bug Reporting Workflow

Bugs were documented using a structured format:

```txt
Bug ID:
Module:
Title:
Description:
Preconditions:
Steps to Reproduce:
Expected Result:
Actual Result:
Severity:
Priority:
Criticality:
Status:
Automated:
Trello Ticket:
Evidence:
```

Bugs with `Status = FAIL` in the test case sheet were linked to the bug report area.

---

## n8n Automation Workflow

n8n was used to automate part of the QA bug reporting process.

The workflow was designed to reduce manual work when a test case failed and needed to be reported as a bug.

### Workflow Objective

Automatically create a Trello bug card from the spreadsheet and return the Trello ticket information back to the test case document.

### Workflow Logic

1. A test case is marked as `FAIL` in the spreadsheet.
2. The bug information is prepared using the test case data.
3. n8n creates a new Trello card in the bug board.
4. The Trello card includes:

   * Bug ID.
   * Title.
   * Module.
   * Steps to reproduce.
   * Expected result.
   * Actual result.
   * Severity.
   * Priority.
   * Evidence when available.
5. Trello returns the created card information.
6. n8n updates the spreadsheet with the Trello ticket number or Trello card link.
7. The spreadsheet keeps traceability between:

   * Test case.
   * Bug report.
   * Trello ticket.

### Benefits of the n8n Automation

* Reduces duplicated manual work.
* Keeps bug reports consistent.
* Improves traceability.
* Connects test documentation with Trello.
* Makes it easier to track which failed test cases were already reported.
* Helps keep the QA workflow closer to a real project environment.

---

## Trello Bug Board

Trello was used to manage reported bugs visually.

Suggested columns:

* Backlog of Bugs.
* In Progress.
* Ready for Review.
* Closed.

Each Trello card contains structured information about the defect, including reproduction steps, expected result, actual result, severity, priority, and evidence.

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Open Cypress

```bash
npx cypress open
```

### 4. Run Cypress Tests in Headless Mode

```bash
npx cypress run
```

---

## Git Workflow Used

Basic Git workflow used during the project:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
```

The repository was kept updated through GitHub during the development of the automated tests and documentation.

---

## Key QA Decisions

### Use of Fixtures

Fixtures were used to keep test data separated from test logic.

This makes the tests easier to maintain because data can be updated without modifying the Cypress test flow.

### Use of Custom Commands

Custom commands were used for repeated actions such as filling forms, selecting dates, and logging into the admin panel.

This improves readability and avoids unnecessary code repetition.

### Use of Assertions

Assertions were added to validate both UI behavior and expected outcomes, such as:

* Page content visibility.
* Successful navigation.
* Form validation messages.
* Booking confirmation.
* Admin panel access.
* Contact message confirmation.

### Handling Application Exceptions

The application sometimes throws a React runtime exception. Cypress was configured to avoid stopping all test execution because of known application-side exceptions, while still allowing the QA process to continue.

---

## Known Issues Found

Examples of issues identified during testing:

* Room image `alt` attributes are duplicated and do not describe the correct room type.
* Some validation flows require careful handling because the booking process has two different `Reserve Now` buttons.
* Some UI validations depend on selecting dates before reaching the guest form.
* The application may throw a React runtime exception during page load.

---

## Final Deliverables

* Cypress automation project.
* Manual test case spreadsheet.
* Bug report spreadsheet.
* Trello bug board.
* n8n automation workflow.
* README documentation.
* Screenshots / visual evidence.
* GitHub repository.

---

## Final Status

The project is completed.

The final version includes manual testing documentation, automated Cypress test cases, bug reporting, Trello tracking, and n8n workflow automation for bug card creation and ticket traceability.
